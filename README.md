This is a IoT project for a custom access control designed to run in linux on a raspberry pi using sqlite3 as database,
The access control drives an access control tourniquet with two RFID readers, one for entry and the other for exit.
The system has a web interface in which you can manage users, cards, block and manage the number of entries that each card has to the pool.
